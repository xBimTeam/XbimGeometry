# XbimGeometry

XbimGeometry is part of the [Xbim Toolkit](https://github.com/xBimTeam). 

It contains the the Geometry Engine and Scene processing, which provide geometric and topological operations 
to enable users to visualise models in 3D models, typically as a Tesselated scene or mesh.

The native Geometry Engine is built around the open source [Open Cascade 7.7.0 library](https://www.opencascade.com/content/overview)
which performs much of the boolean operations involve in generating 3D solids. 
This technology is included under a licence which permits the use as part of a larger work, compatible with our open source CDDL licence.

## Getting started

Before using this library you should register the Geometry Engine with the xbim ServiceProvider.

```csharp
	// Either configure the internal Services
	XbimServices.Current.ConfigureServices(opt => opt.AddXbimToolkit(conf => 
		conf.AddGeometryServices()
		));

	// or configure your services and register the provider with xbim:
	
	services.AddXbimToolkit(conf => conf.AddGeometryServices());
	// Once the DI container is built
	XbimServices.Current.UseExternalServiceProvider(serviceProvider);
```


## Compilation

**Visual Studio 2022 is recommended.**
Prior versions of Visual Studio are unlikely to work on this solution.

The [free VS 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) will be fine. 

In order to compile this solution which includes C++ projects you'll need the following additional 
components installed:

- Visual C++ Core desktop features
- VC++ 2022 v143 tools
- Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17134.0) 

The XBIM toolkit [uses the NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xbim.Geometry/) for the management of our published packages.
We have custom MyGet feeds for the *master* and *develop* branches of the solution which are automatically
updated during our CI builds. The [nuget.config](nuget.config) file should automatically add these feeds for you.


## Acknowledgements
We'd like to acknowledge OpenCascade for the use of their library, which is permitted under clause 6 of [their
Licence](https://www.opencascade.com/content/licensing).
