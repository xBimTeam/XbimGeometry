# XBIM - the eXtensible Building Information Modelling (BIM) Toolkit

## What is it?

The xBIM Tookit (eXtensible Building Information Modelling) is an open-source, software development BIM toolkit that 
supports the BuildingSmart Data Model (aka the [Industry Foundation Classes IFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes)).

xBIM allows developers to read, create and view [Building Information (BIM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) Models in the IFC format. 
There is full support for geometric, topological operations and visualisation. In addition xBIM supports 
bi-directional translation between IFC and COBie formats

## Getting Started

You will need Visual Studio 2010 SP1 or newer to compile the Solution. To compile the SceneJSWebViewer sample
project you will require ASP.NET MVC 3.0 to be installed. All solutions target .NET 4.0. The 4.0 Client profile
may be supported for some projects.


Xbim is a software library, and is currently deployed with a number of sample applications to demonstrate its capabilities

* XbimXplorer - a Windows WPF sample application that can open and render 3D IFC models (and native XBIM models ) as well as displaying semantic data.
* Xbim.SceneJSWebViewer - a MVC web application that can open and render 3D IFC models (previously converted to XBIM) using a WebGL compatible browser. 
* XbimConvert - a sample console application to generate native XBIM model and geometry files from an IFC file.
* Xbim.COBie.Client - A sample windows application demonstrating how a COBie spreadsheet can be generated from an IFC model.
* CodeExamples - a sample console application demonstrating how to undertake a number of BIM processes using XBIM

Please note: all the samples in this solution are examples of how to use the Xbim library, and not intended to be used in a 
production environment without further development.
